# QGIS Vertex Compare Plugin

The Vertex Compare plugin allows users to quickly visualise the placement and relationship of vertices
within features. It also provides a way of easily viewing topological discrepancies between features,
aiding data cleansing and maintenance.

Documentation is available at [https://north-road.github.io/vertex_compare/](https://north-road.github.io/vertex_compare/).

*The plugin requires QGIS 3.20 or later.*

The plugin is created by [North Road Consulting](http://north-road.com) on behalf of Natural Resources Canada.
